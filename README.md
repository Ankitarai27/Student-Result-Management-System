## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used

* **Java** – Core programming language
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Encapsulation, abstraction, and modular design
* **Collections Framework** – Efficient data handling and storage
* **Scanner Class** – User input handling
* **File Handling** – Persistent storage of student records

---

## ✨ Key Features

* 📌 Add student personal details and marks
* 🧮 Automatically calculate total marks and percentage
* 🏅 Assign grades based on performance
* 📋 View all stored student results
* 🔍 Search student records using unique student ID
* 💾 Persistent storage using file handling
* 🔄 Automatically loads saved records when the application starts
